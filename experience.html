        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p> My Love for development began in the year of 2006, during the Myspace era. Myspace would allow you to edit your own profile by using HTML and CSS. I had no idea what a HTML was, but by looking at the code I began to learn how to customize my profile whichever way I saw fit. Playing around with the CSS, changing colors, pictures and text. I even put a video player on my page that would autoplay one of my favorite music videos as soon as my profile was visited. Although I learned how to use HTML and CSS I found no use for it after the demise of Myspace and the rise of Facebook. Fast forward 9 years, November 2015. I'm listening to the radio and I hear an ad for enrollment in Treehouse courses. As a lover of knowledge and creativity I found Treehouse to be a great opportunity to advance my knowledge of development and programming. It feels great taking on the challenge of learning something completely foreign to me and to be able to use what I learned to the best of my ability.</p>
